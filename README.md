# Engineering @ Gitcoin

Welcome to Gitcoin's engineering blog. This repository contains the code for
running the engineering blog and the content we've published. The purpose of
this blog is to share how we're approaching engineering at Gitcoin. It is built
by our engineering teams (Passport, Grants Stack, and Allo) and is intended for
engineers across web3.
