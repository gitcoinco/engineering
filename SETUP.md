# 🔧 Setup

This guide walks you through setting up the Gitcoin Engineering blog locally. If
you wish to contribute to this blog, either by writing an article or modifying
the code for the blog site, you'll want to follow this guide first.

## Background

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and the
[Bookworm](https://github.com/themefisher/bookworm-light-astro) theme.

## ⚙️ Install prerequisites (once for a machine)

**Node Installation:** [Install node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [Recommended LTS version]

## 🖥️ Local setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

After that, it will open up a preview of the template in your default browser,
watch for changes to source files, and live-reload the browser when changes are
saved.

## 🔨Production Build

If you want to create a production build, then run the build command:

```sh
npm run build
```
